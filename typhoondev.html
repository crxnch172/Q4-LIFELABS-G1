    A typhoon forms when winds blow into areas of the ocean where the water is warm.<br> This creates pressure, which causes the winds to move very quickly.<br> The winds rotate, or spin, around a center called an eye. The more warm air and moisture there is,<br> the more intense the winds. Typhoons start off as tropical thunderstorms. The strong winds pull in moisture from the oceans. The thunderstorms convert the moisture into heat. The heat causes more air to flow to the centre of the storm causing evaporation. All the heat and air flow toward the eye creating the typhoon.
    The Philippines also lies within the “Typhoon Belt” where ⅓ of the world’s typhoons form. This is why the Philippines frequently experience typhoons.
