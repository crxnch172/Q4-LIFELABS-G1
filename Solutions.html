   -<strong> Build Sturdy Infrastructure </strong><br>
   Opting for a stronger and sturdier infrastructure can be more expensive but in the longer term, this could definitely lessen a lot of expenses caused by the typhoon.
   <br>
   -<strong>Disaster Preparedness</strong><br>
   Organize frequent seminars within the community to explain the importance of First Aid, 
 Emergency Kits, and Typhoon Awareness/Preparedness. Encourage the people in the community to
              create their own response to disasters.<br>
    -<strong>Evacuation Plans</strong><br>
    Create a detailed Evacuation Plan which includes escape routes and a way of transportation for people with disabilities. Ensure that the Evacuation Site is well-equipped with amenities and needed resources.
    <br>
    -<strong>Early Warning/Detection System</strong>
    Think about making a purchase for an Early Detection Device to detect typhoons and warn the country as soon as possible. This could give us additional time as a result to be ready for a typhoon.
    <br>
    -<strong>Set Priorities</strong><br>
    Prioritize evacuating people who have disabilities, people who live on a mountainous area as this is a landslide prone area, this also applies on people who live near the coast as storm surges can make water levels rise to an abnormal level. 
    <br>
    -<strong>Set Seminars/Campaigns</strong><br>
    As students, we are capable of doing this. We can inform the community on how disaster preparedness can greatly minimize the typhoonâ€™s impact.
    <br>
    -<strong>Publication</strong><br>
    As students, we can spread awareness of how typhoons can impact our community and how we can mitigate them. By means of spreading awareness, we can do it by using posters, pamphlets, and infographics and then posting them on social media. Another is that we can create a podcast on how we can spread awareness about the impacts of typhoons and how we can mitigate them.
