    Since the Philippines is located in the western region of the Pacific Ocean,<br> where it is believed to have the hottest ocean water temperatures, the Philippines is prone to typhoons. <br>
    Throughout the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), the typhoon season commonly starts from June and ends<br> in November (most of them being in the months of August and October), about 20 cyclones enter the PAR on an <br> annual basis, about 8 of them make landfall.
    There are many ways to mitigate the risk of a typhoon. The best way is to prepare beforehand, is making sure the drainage is unclogged to avoid floods, and stocking up for food incase of emergencies. For during, board up as much as you can and stay in the basement to avoid stray and loose debris. For after, avoid wires that have fallen into the water, and remain calm.
